      <h2>Minnesota</h2>
      <p>
        I was born and raised in Eagan, Minnesota. I attended school in Eagan
        from Kindergarten to 8th grade, after which I moved to Eden Prairie. This
        was a scary move, because I had to start high school without knowing anybody!
        However, it all worked out for the best. I made the Varsity Gymnastics
        team, became the Vice President of Competitive Events for DECA, participated
        in Model UN, and founded the Helping Hands club where we sewed mittens for
        homeless shelters in the winter. After high school, it was time to head off
        on a new adventure to college in Madison, Wisconsin.

      <h2>Wisconsin</h2>
      <p>
        I attended college at the University of Wisconsin Madison. My major was
        Engineering Mechanics and Astronautics and my minors were Computer Science
        and Mathematics. I joined the Robotics team my first year of college, where
        I had my first introduction to C. I was also on the NAIGC Gymnastics team
        for the first two years of college, where I went on to compete at Nationals
        and qualify for the Balance Beam finals. I also became the STEM Liaison for
        the Campus Women's Center my second year, and hosted several workshops about
        Imposter Syndrom for women in STEM. I started working for Maydm as a teacher
        my third year, which was an organization dedicated to bringing young women of
        color into Computer Science. Finally, I started working at the Computational
        Nuclear Engineering Research Group my third year, which is where I mastered
        Python, Git, and Docker. I am so thankful for my experiences in college,
        and I wouldn't trade them for the world.

      <h2>Hungary</h2>
      <p>
        I decided to study abroad in Budapest, Hungary at the Budapest University
        of Technology and Engineering, which is the oldest engineering university
        in Europe! I took classes such as Algorithms, Vibrations, and Information
        Security. While I was there, I had the opportunity to travel to France, Sweden,
        Austria, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Ireland, Spain, Poland, Croatia,
        Germany, Belgium, Italy, and Vatican City with my friends! It was amazing
        to learn about the rich history in all of these places, but I am so glad
        I chose Budapest as my home base. It will always have a special place in my heart.

      <h2>Virginia</h2>
      <p>
        The summer before my last year of college, I managed to land a Software Engineering
        internship with General Dynamics Mission Systems. I had so much fun that I decided
        I wanted to work for this company when I graduated from college. I applied for
        something called the Engineering Leadership Program, where young engineers could
        do three rotations, each one year in length, at a selection of GDMS facilities
        around the country. I had always wanted to live on the East Coast, so my
        boyfriend and I packed up and headed out to Arlington, Virginia where I had
        secured a position as a Software Developer on the Tactical Control System program,
        which is the software that is on the Navy's submarines, for my first rotation. We
        had so much fun living so close to Washington D.C. and experiencing the beautiful
        parks, delicious food, and world-class museums.

      <h2>North Carolina</h2>
      <p>
        After my rotation on TCS was done, it was time to move on to my next rotation
        in Greensboro, North Carolina. I am currently working as a Software Developer
        and the Post Mission Analysis Lead of the Knifefish program, which is an
        unmanned underwater vehicle that hunts for mines in a combat area. I have only
        been here for a short time, but I am learning so much and I can't wait to see
        what the next seven months have in store for me.
