# CS 601 Final Project
The repository for my portfolio website final project for MET CS 601.

## Demonstration Suggestions
I implemented two of the suggestions that Professor Looper gave me during my
final demonstration. The first was to remove the default browser margin around
my content, and the second was to make my footer sticky.

## Extra Credit Elements
#### ES6 Features
There are several ES6 features we discussed in Module 5 implemented on my
website. They include using let & const to define variables in each JS file,
using arrow functions in each JS file, and using a template string to define
HTML5 elements in my Vue component.
#### Database Functionality
I am using a realtime database hosted on Firebase to manage the Testimonials
page of my website. My code allows users to submit information from the
testimonial form to my database, and it also retrieves all current entries and
displays them in a table. In addition to this, I am using the Yahoo Finance API
to get realtime information about the current stock price of the General Dynamics
Corporation and display it on the Current Work page of my website.
#### CSS Grid Layout
I am using a CSS Grid layout on every page of my website.

## Required Elements
#### Design & Layout
Each page on my website uses the same stylesheet to create a cohesive theme
that supports the content and is visually pleasing. The layout is simple, which
enhances the readability of the site. Finally, the layout is liquid and will
adjust based on the width of the browser window.
#### Text
All the text on my website is unique and contributes to the overall narrative
of who I am as a developer. The font I chose is readable, and I used the Spelling
& Grammar tool from Microsoft Word to correct any errors in my content.
#### Navigation
Each page on my website has an identical user-friendly navigation bar, which
makes the relationship between the pages clear and my content well organized.
#### Images
Each image on my website has alt, height, and width attributes. They clearly
relate to and support the content on each page. There are no excessive or
unnecessary graphic effects.
#### Mechanics
There are no missing graphics or broken links on my website. It can be viewed
in both Firefox and Chrome without issue. The video of my balance beam routine
will not play on Safari, despite my best efforts.
#### HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue, and DOM
My website shows a clear understanding of how to use HTML5 semantic elements,
how to organize and apply a cohesive CSS stylesheet, and how to use JavaScript
to perform actions such as accessing and updating a database, communicating
with an external API, and dynamically updating the DOM. I use HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript on each page in my website in a meaningful way. Finally, I show
a clear understanding of Vue on the Past Work page.
#### Validation
I validated each HTML, CSS, and JavaScript file in my website with the following links.
1. HTML: https://validator.w3.org/nu/
2. CSS: https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/
3. JavaScript: https://beautifytools.com/javascript-validator.php
