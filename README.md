## Notes for the Midterm Review
Hello! My website is still under construction, but I was hoping to take this
opportunity to receive feedback and take time to make any course corrections
before the final week of class. I am planning several more updates in the
coming weeks, including updating the testimonial database to add entries from
any visitor to the site, adding a new page about the places I have traveled to,
and adding in more JavaScript where appropriate to show I have mastered it.
Thank you so much for taking the time to look at it, I hope you enjoy!
