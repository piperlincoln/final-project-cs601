      <p>
        I am the Post Mission Analysis Lead for the Knifefish program at General
        Dynamics Mission Systems. We operate in the Agile Scrum framework, and
        I am responsible for planning our work in JIRA, tracking our risks,
        and communicating our progress to leadership. I also participate in the
        software development work alongside my team. For more information on the
        program, visit the website below.
